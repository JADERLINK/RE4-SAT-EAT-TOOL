# RE4-SAT-EAT-TOOL

## Flags
Attention: The flags used in Eat are different from those used in Sat, so even if they are the same value, the meanings are different;

* The file "m_Status flags SAT documented.txt" contains the flags used in the SAT file;
* The file "m_Status flags EAT documented.txt" contains the flags used in the EAT file;
* The file "m_Status flags SAT values used.txt" contains the combinations of flags used in SAT files;
* The file "m_Status flags EAT values used.txt" contains the combinations of flags used in EAT files;
